## Description
In this weeks project we giving the task to create a personalize portfolio. This being the first time as a new beginning developer, that I had to make a full webpage from scatch was challenging to say the least. I first started with a rough drawing in drawio that is used loosely in the final product. From there I started with the html and got the frame work all together. Then started adding some styles with the CSS page, to now having a final rough draft.

## File types
- Html
- CSS
- Drawio
